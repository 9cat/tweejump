## Notes

- you control a twitter bird by tilting device left and right
- the bird is constantly jumping
- you just tilt device to move it left or right
- you jump on platforms, which looks like chat balloons
- the higher you climb the more "followers" you get
- on the way you collect:
  - replies -- '@' symbols
  - hashtags -- '#' symbols
